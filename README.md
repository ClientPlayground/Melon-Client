## Disclaimer
This repo is for educational purposes only!

The purpose of is repo is because Kaimson is an idiotic skid.

## Extra Info
I didn't decompile the source yet, so the runnable Minecraft launcher version is in the releases category. You may decompile the jar with [Luyten](https://github.com/deathmarine/Luyten) (or another decompiler) if you wish.
